# MessageMischief
This is a little batch script that allows you to spam Windows computers that are on the same LAN, by sending a message with the `msg` command.

## Usage
```batch
spammer.bat <ip> <text> <count>
```
`Ã¬p` is the ip addres or hostname that will be spammed

`text` is the message that will appear in the message popup on your victim's PC.

If `count` is `0`, it will spam infinitely :)

**Note:** all paremeters must be specified for the script to work.
