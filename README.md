# MessageMischief
This is a little batch script that allows you to spam Windows computers that are on the same LAN, by sending a message with the `msg` command.

## Usage
```batch
spammer.bat <ip> <text> <count>
```
If the third parameter (send cound) is `0`, it will spam infinitely :)

Note: all paremeters must be specified for the script to work.
